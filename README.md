# üßæ Invoice Automation Script
This Python script automates the creation and emailing of tutoring invoices. It pulls session and client data from a Google Sheet, generates a custom LaTeX invoice for each client based on session dates, compiles the invoice to PDF using MiKTeX‚Äôs `pdflatex`, and emails the PDF directly to the client.

This helps simplify and speed up your billing workflow while maintaining professional invoice formatting.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup & Configuration

Before running the script, you‚Äôll need to set up several external services and configurations:

1. **Google Cloud API Setup**
   - Create a [Google Cloud Project](https://console.cloud.google.com).
   - Enable the Google Sheets API and Google Drive API.
   - Create a service account and download its JSON credentials file (`credentials.json`).
   - Share your Google Sheet with the service account email to grant access.

2. **Google Sheet Preparation**
   - Organize your session, client, and cutoff data according to the ranges specified in your `.env` file.
   - Ensure invoice number cell and other config values are set up properly.
   - My sample setup is shown in the picture below.

3. **MiKTeX Installation (for LaTeX compilation)**
   - Install MiKTeX on your system.
   - Add MiKTeX‚Äôs `pdflatex` to your system PATH so it can be invoked from the command line.
   - [MiKTeX Download](https://miktex.org/download)

4. **Email Setup (Gmail example)**
   - Enable 2-Step Verification on your [Google Account](https://myaccount.google.com/security).
   - Generate an **App Password** specifically for the script to send emails securely.
   - Replace the email and password placeholders in your `.env` file.

5. **Environment Variables**
   - Create a `.env` file and fill it with important data.
   - See [.env.example](.env.example) for a sample setup.
